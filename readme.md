**ABOUT SYSTEM**

This system was used as registration system at hackathon "Code cHallenge by Switch". This system was to handle applications of participants as they register their teams to compete.

Code Challange by Switch is a competitive character project. The main goal of the project is to encourage students to apply       practical knowledge in programming. All students of the University of Mostar have the right to participate in the competition. Students can apply in teams with maximum of 3 members.

We encourage contestants to create open source software solutions. Competitors can make their ideas in the form of web applications, mobile apps (Android, iOS), desktop applications, or APIs. Use of ready-made program packages (frameworks, libraries) and all programming languages are allowed.
